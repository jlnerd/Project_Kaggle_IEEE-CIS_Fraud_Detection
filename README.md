# IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection (Kaggle)
https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/overview

## Overview
In this competition, we benchmark machine learning models on a challenging large-scale dataset. The data comes from Vesta's real-world e-commerce transactions and contains a wide range of features from device type to product features. We also have the opportunity to create new features to improve your results.

## Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.
For each TransactionID in the test set, you must predict a probability for the isFraud variable.
